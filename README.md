#### Data Science Exercise: Loan Default Prediction with Lending Club Data

by Combiz Khozoie, Ph.D.

A logistic regression model built for a binomial classification problem.  Includes a write-up and code written in R.  Concepts covered include: -

- Data wrangling operations
- Proportional stratified random sampling to address class imbalance
- Cross-validation and train/test data partitioning
- Logistic regression modelling with rapid genetic algorithm for independent (predictor) variable selection
- Visualisation of predictor variable influence by odds-ratio extraction and plotting
- Geographic visualisation of model coefficients by region using a heatmap overlay on a map (choropleth)
- Model evaluation using common performance metrics for binomial classification problems (e.g. confusion matrix, Youden's Index, Gini-index, KS score, and ROC plot / AUC).
